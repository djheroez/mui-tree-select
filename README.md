Designed to easily work with [React MUI](https://material-ui.com/) and form frameworks such
as [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) and [Formik](https://formik.org).

## Examples

- [React hook form](https://github.com/djheroez/mui-tree-select/tree/main/examples/rhf-int)
- [Formik](https://github.com/djheroez/mui-tree-select/tree/main/examples/formik-int)

## How to build the Tree

To build the tree we use a hierarchy field that follows the dot notation, e.g:
L.L1 would be:

- L
  - L1

Refer to the examples to see how is used.
